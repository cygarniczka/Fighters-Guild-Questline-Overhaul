Description
============
Mod preserves the original Morrowind Fighters Guild questsline while adding new ways of completing quests:
-new way of completing the quests; jailing bounty targets, staging deaths, warning / chasing away targets or lying to quest givers
-run Ald'ruhn guild hall at the end of the questline
-you can side with Sjoring Hard-Heart and much more

Fighters Guild Questline Overhaul includes:

-about dozen new quests

-almost all Fighters Guild quests now have extra content

-possibility to side with Sjoring Hard-Heart without turning it into eagerly overenthusiastic venture

-new alternative ways of completing or failing the Fighters Guild quests while original way of completing quest remains unchanged

-warn, jail, persuade, chase away, enslave/sell, stage accidental deaths of ( bounty ) targets

-settle debt quests by killing creditors or debitors, pay debt yourself or forbid creditor from collecting the debt if you're in position of power ( player has House Grandmaster title )

-how you finish the quests will sometimes have consequences down the road e.g. knowing who is Hrundi's lover can impact Rels Tenim bounty quest.

-Tamriel Rebuilt content. Be careful who you double cross. Tamriel Rebuilt is not required for mod to function properly.

-minor Go to Jail cross cotnent. Go to Jail is not required for mod to function correctly.

-new AiPackages and cutscenes

-time based events

-possibility to become a steward at Ald'ruhn guild hall:
	
	-recruit, promote/demote or expel guild members

	-send NPCs on quests which they complete successfully, fail, die or flee from; some will have consequences

	-guild members will refuse to do quests or leave your guild hall if you don't treat them right

	-encounter NPCs you sent on job in Morrowind world

	-possibility to play immoral guild steward. Consequences of failure will apply both to player and NPCs; public executions and exile from Ald'ruhn

	-voiced execution speech for palyer and NPCs. Ruffin Vangarr thank you for the voiceovers. :)

-bully Fargoth or not; witness Hrisskar Flat-Foot harassing the Bosmer

-interact with and/or work for some Vvardenfell's criminals

-player who belongs to Camonna Tong will have some quests impacted by faction affiliation ( requires external mod Join Camonna Tong or Camonna Tong mod that uses original Camonna 
Tong faction ID

-half dozen new quests and new joinable faction the Verethi Gang ( WIP)

-guild hall massacre if you play your cards right...

-Pemenie﻿ now has a bounty quest. You can do the quest yourself or send a NPC to do it and encounter your bounty hunter actually doing a job when you go Pemenie's location

-peaceful resolution to Recovering Cloudcleaver quest compatible with Cloudcleaver for Good Guys. Unlike in Cloudcleaver for Good Guys you don't have to kill anyone


============
Permissions
============
You can use my ESP file as you see fit; updates, fixes, changes etc. For voice files you need to contact Ruffin Vangarr on Morrowind Modding Community discord.
To use assets you need to follow permissions given by Westly ( corprus stalkers assets ), Kiteflyer61 ( kb_crows_cage_01.nif ), Meriyal ( dk_feast_arm_re.nif ). 

=============
Installation
=============
Installation: Standard unpack the files and activate the ESP. Recommended new game. Once you leave Seyda Neen you will be asked about which engine you use to run your Morrowind. Choose Original if you use Morrowind.exe or OpenMM. If you don't know what OpenMW is always choose original.

==================
Compatibility
==================
Morrowind Rebirth - likely to conflict

Antares' Big Mod  - I examined the mod in CS it should be compatible and it fits nicely when you attain the rank of Master of the Fighters Guild.

Fighters Guild : Reanimation﻿ - should be compatible. I examined the mod in CS and didn't find any conflicts with FGQO

Cloudcleaver for Good Guys - compatible.

Earthly Delights - compatible.

Cutting Room Floor - compatible. Load Cutting Room Floor above/before my mod:

Will conflict with mods that edit scripts:

anoScript

eydisScript

lorbumolScript

sjoringScript

staceyScript


Will conflict with mods that edit NPCs:

Helviane Desele ( minor - dance won't start )

Baurin ( minor she won't forcegreet you if you kill Hard-Heart )

Per request I will provide compatibility patches for conflicting mods that edit vanilla records.

=====================
Known Issues or Bugs
=====================
I tested the mod as much as possible both on OpenMW and Morrowind.exe ( original engine). I squashed vast majority of the technical bugs. 
The mod grew in size over time I added new features and extended quests. I may missed something. Make a valid bug report and I will try to fix it.

Morrowind.exe  engine. Dwalin2012 and Gavrilo93 reported that chasing Khajiit scene halts with Khajiit stopping after running for a short time.
The chase works on my PC. Here is video from chase: https://streamable.com/6qbtw9

Thank you NifTools for NifSkope
Thank you to the community for the continuing support.
Thank you to AlienSlof for initally pointing me down the
right paths when I first began making mods.

Permissions = Feel free to use this mod as you like (just do not re-upload or
redistribute this as it is in this archive). If you would like to use this in
a mod separate from this given mod, then please make sure that the appropriate
credits are acknowledged and that I am notified so as to assist you if necessary:D.
If any changes are made to textures or meshes, then rename them so as to
not conflict with the original textures/meshes.

I do ask that races not be made from these creatures, nor that the
clothing be made wearable (as this is something that I am currently
working on myself to save all you wonderful people that would
want to play as one of these creatures the tedium that might come
from attempting to make these playable without the source files
at the ready).
